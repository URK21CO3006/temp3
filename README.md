 given the health data of various countries with different years,as we know health varies from person to person , taking it as a big population it might vary in a 
 large scale when it is compared to different countries and years,it also gives us a brief idea about the country's overall development and contribution in the field of
 health.Thus,this model is made to focus upon the country's health status in the upcoming years by making a brief comparison among other countries and changes that 
 occured throughout the years.
